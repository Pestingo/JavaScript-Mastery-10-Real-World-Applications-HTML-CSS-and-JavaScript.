## Features
- Add tasks dynamically
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks when no longer needed
- Store tasks in local storage to retain data after page refresh
- Responsive design for seamless user experience

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity

## How It Works
1. **Adding Tasks**: Users can input a task and click the 'Add' button to insert it into the list.
2. **Marking Tasks as Completed**: Clicking on a task marks it as completed (strikethrough effect applied).
3. **Deleting Tasks**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
4. **Persistent Data**: The application utilizes local storage to save tasks, ensuring they remain after page reloads.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Pestingo/Project-1-To-Do-List-Application.git

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will learn:
- How to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- How to use **local storage** to persist data.
